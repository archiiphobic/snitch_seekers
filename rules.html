        <h1>How to Play Quidditch</h1>
        <div class="sub-box">
        <p>Welcome to Snitch Seekers! New to the game? You should know the following things about Quidditch:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each team has 7 players — 3 Chasers, 2 Beaters, 1 Keeper, and 1 Seeker.</li>
            <li>The goal of the game is to score more points than the opposing team by throwing the Quaffle through one of the opponent’s three goal hoops.</li>
            <li>Chasers score goals with the Quaffle, earning 10 points per goal.</li>
            <li>Beaters use bats to hit the Bludgers toward opponents to knock them off their brooms or disrupt their play.</li>
            <li>The Seeker's job is to catch the Golden Snitch, which is worth 150 points.</li>
            <li>The Keeper guards the goal hoops and tries to block the Quaffle from going through.</li>
            <li>Catching the Snitch ends the game and earns the seeker’s team 150 points, often deciding the winner.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>Enjoy playing Snitch Seekers!</p>

        <h1>GAME RULES</h1>
        <div class="sub-box">
        <ul>
            <li>Rule 1: Respect other players and their choices.</li>
            <li>Rule 2: Follow the game's objectives and guidelines.</li>
            <li>Rule 3: Each team has assigned roles (Scorer, Defender, Disruptor, Seeker), and players must play within their role’s abilities.</li>
            <li>Rule 4: No cheating or exploiting game mechanics.</li>
            <li>Rule 5: Score points by sending the main ball through the opponent’s goal zones.</li>
            <li>Rule 6: Avoid or block disruptor objects that can temporarily slow, stun, or knock players off course.</li>
            <li>Rule 7: A special target (like a Golden Snitch) appears randomly, and capturing it gives a large point bonus and may end the match.</li>
            <li>Rule 8: Fair play is required — no cheating, exploiting bugs, or using offensive language; violations may result in penalties or bans.</li>
            <li>Rule 9: Report any bugs or issues to the game moderators.</li>
            <li>Rule 10: Have fun and enjoy the game!</li>
